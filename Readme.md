This app will gather information about your playlists to enhance your listening experience.

It will also allow me to learn more about python and the Flask framework.

1. Modify the order of the songs in a playlist
2. Delete songs that do not get played often.
3. Rotate the first 10 songs in a playlist so it wont be too predictable.
